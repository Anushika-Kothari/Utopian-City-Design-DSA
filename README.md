# Problem Statement
The challenge of designing a utopian city is of immense importance.
The City of Utopia is committed to creating a better future for its citizens and visitors.
In order to ensure this, we need to implement a city model that will provide a
comprehensive framework for the city to develop and grow sustainably.
This model should include a plan for infrastructure and public services, a vision for the
city's economy, and a strategy for addressing social and environmental challenges.
It should also take into account the needs of the citizens, including their safety, health,
and well-being.
The city model should be developed with input from stakeholders and experts, and
should be long-term, adaptable, and flexible in order to accommodate future changes.
This model will serve as the foundation for Utopia's future success, and is essential for
creating a livable and prosperous city.
We need to design a city model for a utopian city that is socially, economically and
environmentally sustainable.
Furthermore, the model must be designed to ensure that the city is resilient in the face of
climate change, economic and social disruption, and any other potential problems.
In addition to this, the model must be cost-effective and take into account the needs of
all citizens and all stakeholders involved.The framework includes but is not limited to:
• An efficient transportation system.
• An efficient waste management system.
• Comprehensive housing policy.
• Equitable taxation system.
• Promotes a healthy lifestyle.
• Comprehensive education system.
